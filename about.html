        <p>
Adkins Elloz develops images through constraint.
Flat color direct gesture and limited form define the practice.
        </p>

        <p>
There is no narrative.
There is no symbolism offered as guidance.
What remains is meant to be lived with not decoded.
        </p>

        <p>
The work holds space.
It does not resolve.
        </p>
  <p>
Adkins Elloz lives and works in California.
The practice unfolds through series.
Each series operates as a closed system built on repetition and insistence.
        </p>
