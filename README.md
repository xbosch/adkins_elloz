# Adkins Elloz  
## MoonLight Art Gallery

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **Adkins Elloz**.

The site presents a body of work developed through reduction, constraint, and repetition.  
It is published using GitHub Pages and intentionally avoids frameworks, tooling, and dynamic behavior.

## Artist Statement

Adkins Elloz develops images through constraint.  
Flat color, direct gesture, and limited form define the practice.

There is no narrative.  
There is no symbolism offered as guidance.

What remains is meant to be lived with, not decoded.

The work holds space.  
It does not resolve.

Each series operates as a closed system.  
Repetition is not variation.  
It is insistence.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists solely to host and maintain the public website.

It is not a template.  
It is not a library.  
It is not intended for reuse.

The code is minimal by design.  
The focus is the work, not the implementation.

## Website Structure

The site is entirely static and organized as follows:

/
├── index.html        Home
├── about.html        Artist information
├── contact.html      Contact and inquiries
├── css/
│   └── style.css     Global styles
├── gallery/
│   ├── index.html    Gallery overview
│   ├── olives.html   Olives series
│   ├── faces.html    Faces series
│   └── symbols.html  Symbols series
└── images/
    ├── olives/
    ├── faces/
    └── symbols/

Each series page introduces the work as a sequence.  
Each artwork page is self contained and intentionally sparse.

## Design Principles

- Static HTML and CSS only  
- No JavaScript  
- No tracking or analytics  
- No animations  
- Neutral background  
- Text as structure  
- Images treated as physical objects  

The site is designed to hold space rather than occupy it.

---

## Deployment

The site is deployed using **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch.

Any commit pushed to `main` triggers an automatic update of the live site.  
No build step is required.

### Update workflow

git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push

GitHub Pages typically updates the site within seconds to one minute.
