      <p>
        The Olives series explores a single form pushed through variation rather than repetition.
        Each work holds the same visual structure while shifting balance, color, and tension.

        Seen together, the pieces operate as a sequence.
        Small differences accumulate.
        The dialogue between works becomes the subject.

        The series rewards sustained looking.
        What appears simple at first reveals its complexity through proximity and comparison.

        Acquiring the full set preserves this internal rhythm.
        It secures the work not as isolated statements, but as a complete visual argument.

        The series is available both individually and as a whole.
        The set is offered at a preferred rate.
      </p>
