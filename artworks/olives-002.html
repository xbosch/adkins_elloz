      <h1>Holding Ground</h1>

      <p>
        Holding Ground continues the language established by the first piece while shifting the balance of color and weight.
        The form opens up.
        The palette softens without losing intensity.
        The relationship between figure and ground becomes more fluid.
        The diagonal field feels less confrontational and more expansive.
        The composition breathes.

        Black outlines remain decisive.
        Gesture stays visible.
        The surface still carries the hand.

        This work rewards proximity.
        It is quieter than the first but no less deliberate.
        A strong companion piece that stands fully on its own.
      </p>
