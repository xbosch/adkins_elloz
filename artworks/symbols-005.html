    <h1>Standing Mark</h1>

    <p>
This work introduces enclosure.

A single form stands alone against an open field.
It suggests a doorway, a marker, a sign.
But it never resolves into function.

The background is expansive and warm.
The symbol is rigid and upright.
Tension comes from restraint rather than excess.

The black outline asserts authority.
Color remains flat and intentional.
Nothing moves, yet the space feels charged.

This piece is about boundary.
It holds space instead of filling it.
It is the most contained work in the Symbols series.
