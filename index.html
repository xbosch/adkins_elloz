<p>
Artist Adkins Elloz works through reduction.
Forms are stripped to what cannot be removed.
Color is used as structure not decoration.

The work resists explanation.
It does not illustrate ideas.
It establishes presence.

Each series operates as a closed system.
Repetition is not variation.
It is insistence.
  </p>
        <p>
Original works built from flat color forms and direct gesture.
Nothing decorative. Nothing symbolic.
Only presence.
        </p>

        <p>
Each series reduces the image to what cannot be removed.
What remains is meant to be lived with.
        </p>
